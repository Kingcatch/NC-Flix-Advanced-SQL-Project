# Advanced SQL Project - NC Flix

Instructions for today's sprint can be found at: https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/data-toolkit/nc-flix

NC Flix ðŸŽ¬
NC Flix is a database-driven project bringing back the nostalgia of video rental stores! This repository contains the database schema and SQL challenges designed to enhance my SQL querying skills.

ðŸ“Œ Setup Instructions
Before starting, navigate to the /db directory and run the setup-db script to initialise the database.

To reset the data and rerun all SQL scripts, use:
./run-all.sh

Through this project I have:

âœ… Built complex SQL queries using subqueries to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.

âœ… Applied aggregate functions to summarise and extract meaningful insights from datasets.

âœ… Used Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to improve query readability and maintainability.

âœ… Implemented set operations like UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT to combine and compare query results.

âœ… Applied conditional logic within SQL queries to handle dynamic scenarios.

âœ… Developed window functions for advanced analytical queries, enabling ranking and partition-based calculations.

âœ… Integrated PostgreSQL with Python using pg8000 and implemented database interactions using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
