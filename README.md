Instructions for today's sprint can be found at: https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/data-toolkit/nc-flix

NC Flix 🎬
NC Flix is a database-driven project bringing back the nostalgia of video rental stores! This repository contains the database schema and SQL challenges designed to enhance my SQL querying skills.

📌 Setup Instructions
Before starting, navigate to the /db directory and run the setup-db script to initialise the database.

To reset the data and rerun all SQL scripts, use:
./run-all.sh

Through this project I have:

✅ Built complex SQL queries using subqueries to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.
✅ Applied aggregate functions to summarise and extract meaningful insights from datasets.
✅ Used Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to improve query readability and maintainability.
✅ Implemented set operations like UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT to combine and compare query results.
✅ Applied conditional logic within SQL queries to handle dynamic scenarios.
✅ Developed window functions for advanced analytical queries, enabling ranking and partition-based calculations.
✅ Integrated PostgreSQL with Python using pg8000 and implemented database interactions using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
